# Customer-Personality-Analysis
Analyzing customer data using the R programming language, statistical analyzes and visual visualizations.

We did a customer personality analysis project
We downloaded the dataset from the Kaggel website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis)
And then we loaded it into R-studio
And we explored it by seeing the summary and the structure of the columns,
And we made simple modifications to the data such as removing the null values and correcting some data type,
Then statistical calculations, and then we made a survey on the personal information,
Next we made some data visualizations
